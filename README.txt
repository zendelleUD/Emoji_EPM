APP Description:
When launched, the application will open to a greeting page,
after playing the "Play" button, a new view controller will come onto screen
to display the Emoji Per Minute tester.
I have added a button on the side of the textfield to change the function. The default function calculate the correct amount of emojis inputted, the second function calcuted the totalamount of keys to show the display works.
Once the user begins typing into the field box, the timer will start and the user will have 1 minute to input the correct emojis as fast as possible. At the end of the timer, a new view controller will be displayed with the Emojis per Minute, a retry button, and close button.
